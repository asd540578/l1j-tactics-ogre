2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE

NC Interactive offers Lineage as a fee-based online fantasy role-playing game service accessible (the "Service") through the Internet at "www.lineagethebloodpledge.com" (the "Web Site").

To use the Service, you will need to install software which NC Interactive makes available from the Web Site (the "Software").

NC Interactive does not provide Internet access, and you are responsible for all fees associated with your Internet connection and telecommunication costs. The Web Site located at www.lineagethebloodpledge.com is an active part of the Service and any use of the website is governed by the same Terms of Agreement and Rules of Conduct.
