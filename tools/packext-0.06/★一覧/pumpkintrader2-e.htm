<br><p>To deal with the evildoers, you will need two kinds of items filled with our spiritual power.</p>  
<p>First, use pumpkin candy to attract them. If you put it on the ground, the evil ones will be the first to come running to eat it. Inside this candy there is an ingredient that, once eaten, grabs hold of their substance and they won't be able to run away. If you kill them at this time, they will drop a pumpkin seed, which is a cursed intermediary item. Get this and bring it to me.</p>  
<p>The second item is the pumpkin mask. This is something that causes their usual invisible appearance to become visible. You won't be able to see them if you don't use this. And you can't kill what you don't see... So you definitely need this to kill them.</p>
<p>Finally, there's one last thing of which you should be aware. Normally, these evildoers are hardly a match for you but there is one among them who is very strong. He is extremely powerful and can be seen even if you don't use the pumpkin mask. It is said that his strength is such as to be able to confront a dragon and if you meet him, you'll do best to just run straight away. I entreat you one more time about this... you'll be risking your life to oppose him. Nevertheless, if you can fight with and kill this powerful evildoer, he will drop a giant pumpkin seed. Bring this to me and I'll trade it for 10 regular pumpkin seeds.</p>
