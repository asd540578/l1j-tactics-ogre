<p>You become an invisible eye if you use an arena viewing ticket and this lets you go around seeing things directly. You even get the feeling that you are watching the fights right in front of your eyes. When you're ready to leave, just ask the guard inside the stadium.</p>
<p>However, during the time that you are an invisible eye, your pets become as if they don't have an owner - so be careful. I'm warning you clearly because even I'm tired of there being so many accidents like that.</p>
