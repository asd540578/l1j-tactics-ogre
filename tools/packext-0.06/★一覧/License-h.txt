 may be language or other material
 accessible on or through the
 Service that may be inappropriate
 for children or offensive to some
 users of any age.
  NC Interactive cannot ensure
 that other players will not
 provide Content or access to
 Content that parents or guardians
 may find inappropriate or that
 any user may find objectionable.

 content of the materials or
 communications transmitted
 by each player.

 we do not ensure continuous,
 error-free, secure or virus-free

 THE SOFTWARE, YOUR ACCOUNT
 OR THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER OR

  Notwithstanding anything else in
 this Agreement, no default, delay
 or failure to perform on the part
 of NC Interactive shall be
 considered a breach of this
 Agreement if such default, delay
 or failure to perform is shown
 to be due to causes beyond the
 reasonable control of NC
